# Airbnb Clone Frontend

This is the frontend for my Airbnb Clone project, built with React and Vite. It is part of a polyrepo full-stack architecture, where the frontend and backend are maintained in separate repositories and communicate via RESTful APIs.

---

## Current Project Status

At this stage, the frontend includes:

- React application initialized with Vite
- Production-style folder structure with separation of concerns
- React Router configuration with nested routing
- Shared layout using Header, Footer, and Outlet
- Navigation with active route styling using `NavLink`
- Centralized Axios API client with credential support
- Environment-based backend URL configuration using Vite `.env`
- Successful frontend-to-backend API communication
- Fully functional user registration flow
- Fully functional user login flow with cookie-based authentication
- Full booking system with reservation management
- Booking cancellation flow
- Pagination system for listings
- Auto-login after successful registration
- Reusable back button navigation
- Responsive booking and listing layouts

### API Layer

- Centralized Axios instance (api.js)
- Dynamic base URL using environment variables
- withCredentials: true for secure cookie-based authentication

### Listings (Places) System

### Booking System

#### Create Booking

- Reservation form on listing details page
- Controlled booking form inputs
- Dynamic total price calculation
- Frontend booking validation before submission
- Booking creation via POST /bookings

#### Availability System

- Fetch active booking ranges for a listing
- Frontend overlap validation
- Backend overlap enforcement
- Disabled unavailable dates using React DayPicker
- Prevents double bookings

#### Booking Management

- User bookings page
- Individual booking details page
- Booking cancellation flow
- Dynamic status updates (active / cancelled)
- Cancelled bookings reopen availability

#### - Create Listing
- Controlled form with dynamic state management
- Photo URL input with add/remove functionality
- Amenities selection using checkbox system
- Form validation before submission
- POST request to /places
### Edit Listing

- Pre-filled form using fetched data
- Controlled updates with PATCH requests
- Dynamic state hydration from backend
- Photo management (add/remove)

### Delete Listing

- Delete action with confirmation prompt
- Optimistic UI update using state filtering
- DELETE request to /places/:id

### User Listings Dashboard

- Fetches authenticated user listings (/places/user-places)
- Displays listings in responsive card layout
- Conditional rendering (loading, empty state, data)
- Skeleton loading UI for improved UX

### Listing Details Page

- Dynamic route: /places/:id
- Fetch single listing by ID
- Displays:
    - Title
    - Address
    - Main image
    - Description
    - Price
    - Amenities
- Handles loading and error states

### UI/UX Enhancements

- Skeleton loading states for data fetching
- Hover interactions and clickable cards
- Button interaction feedback (hover/transform)
- Responsive card layouts
- Clean form structure and spacing
- Reusable styling system
- Responsive booking calendar UX
- Disabled submit states during async operations
- Success and error feedback messaging
- Availability-aware reservation flow
- Unified reusable card design system

### What I Learned

- Building production-style React architecture
- Managing global vs local state (Context vs component state)
- Handling authentication with cookies and protected routes
- Designing scalable folder structures
- Implementing full CRUD flows in frontend
- Managing controlled forms and complex state updates
- Handling async data fetching and loading states
- Understanding event bubbling and stopPropagation
- Designing user-friendly UI/UX patterns
- Implementing frontend + backend availability systems
- Date overlap validation logic
- Responsive UI architecture
- Calendar-based booking UX
- Production-style form state management
- Real-world async UX patterns

### API Relationship Example

- Frontend request → /places/:id
- Backend mount → app.use("/places", placeRoutes)
- Route definition → router.get("/:id")
- Final endpoint → /places/:id

### How to Run the Frontend

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
2. Create a .env file in the root:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
3. Start development server:
```
npm run dev
```
### Important Notes

- .env is excluded from version control
- node_modules is ignored
- Frontend and backend are separate repositories (polyrepo setup)
- Backend must be running for API requests to succeed

### Next Steps

- Full mobile responsiveness polish
- Search and filtering system
- Image upload/cloud storage integration
- Favorites/wishlist system
- Review and rating system
- Map integration
- Deployment (Vercel + Render)
